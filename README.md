A React Native Clone of the popular ASOS App, this project was done over one weekend for learning purposes and is theremore not being maintained. Feel free to fork and use as you please.

It is platform agnostic although nearly all work done so far has been written and tested on iOS.

React-Native is a powerful tool for creating UI, and therefore i've focussed only on the UI. The business logic including data retrieval is ommitted from this project.

## Getting Started

- Clone the app

  `git clone https://github.com/edwinbosire/ASOS.git `
  
- run npm in the project root folder

  ` npm install`
  
- run on simulator

  `react-native run-ios --simulator "iPhone 5s"`   
  
  Avoid this by opening the project in xcode and chosing run, this is also a better environment to read & fix build time errors.
